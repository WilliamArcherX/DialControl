This project is a widget version of qt5.14.2 qml demo DialControl. It demonstates how to draw a dial control by using QPainter, then it shows how to use property animation on self-define property. I have run it on window10 and kunbuntu 24.04 dektop. It's develoepd by qtcreator pubished by qt 5.14.2. Enjoy yourself.
